# Y Combinator in JavaScript

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Y Combinator in JavaScript using the standard library. The Y Combinator is a concept from lambda calculus that allows for the creation of recursive functions without naming them.

## Contents

- `yCombinator.js`: Contains the implementation of the Y Combinator and example usage with factorial and Fibonacci functions.

## Running the Code

To run the code, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the following command:

   ```
   node yCombinator.js
   ```

3. You should see the output of the factorial and Fibonacci functions using the Y Combinator.

## Understanding the Y Combinator

The Y Combinator is a higher-order function that enables the creation of recursive functions without explicitly using recursion in the function definition. It's a powerful concept in functional programming and demonstrates the expressive power of first-class functions and closures in JavaScript.

In this implementation, we use the Y Combinator to define factorial and Fibonacci functions without naming them or using explicit recursion in their definitions.
