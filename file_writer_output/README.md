# Y Combinator in JavaScript

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Y Combinator in JavaScript using the standard library. The Y Combinator is a concept in functional programming that allows the creation of anonymous recursive functions.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Run the script using the command:

   ```
   node y_combinator.js
   ```

3. The script will output examples of factorial and Fibonacci calculations using the Y Combinator.

## File Structure

- `y_combinator.js`: Contains the Y Combinator implementation and example usage.
- `package.json`: Project configuration file.
- `README.md`: This file, containing project information and instructions.
